<p>Whether it’s from wearing a full-suit in scorching summer heat while commuting, running around the office,
    or simply stress – sweaty, sticky, and disheveled dress shirts are all too common in the corporate world.
    Not only are dress shirts prone to sweating, but they are also stiff, restrictive, and uncomfortable.

    negatively affecting productivity.  238Hem is an online-only retailer that will offer high-tech custom men’s
